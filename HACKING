You need at least vala 0.14 and devel packages for glib, gtk+ 3.0, cairo, appindicator and libgtop 2.0.

If you got the source from bzr, you need to merge the translations from lp:~indicator-multiload/indicator-multiload/trunk-translations before compiling.

To compile, run
    ./autogen.sh && make

To run without install, use
    make test-run
