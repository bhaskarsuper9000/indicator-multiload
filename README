Reimplementation of the gnome-applets multiload applet in vala and for Canonicals appindicators.

Strings have been kept the same as in gnome-applets where possible to reduce translation work.

For more advanced settings such as which variables are shown and whether graphs
autoscale, open dconf-editor and navigate to /apps/indicators/multiload/.

Expressions are strings with embedded code within $(...). Variables are of the
form provider.variable, a list is available from indicator-multiload -l. You
can use +, -, *, and / for calculations.
